Overview: Nichify is a website that will display your most listened to Spotify genre along with a corresponding image. First, the user logs into their Spotify account, then the top artists will be fethced, their genres are analyzed, and then the website will present the the favorite genre and the corresponding image. Nichify uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript along with Spotify's Web API. 
Usage: First, log in to Spotify and grant permissions. This should appear before anything else on the website. Second, view your top genre and fun moodboard. Third, if you would like to see the rest of the moodboards, scroll down and click the button that says "Click to see all the cores!". If wanted, scroll down on Moodboard page to return to users top genre and image. 
All of the needed information specific to the Spotify API are listed as const varaibles at the top of the script.js file (clietnId, clientSecret, and the token). These should be all the neccessary access codes needed in the js file for the code to properly work.
